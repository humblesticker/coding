differences from regular calculator? software
requirements, need, why, environment? assuming you are talking to ba or producer :) 
and you need to come up with design (as usual but in 30 min)

	click button, display result

blind
	listen for input?
	say result

imagine bc on your computer
blind start app somehow
app should give some direciton to blind
