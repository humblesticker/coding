given a word and dictionary words
get all possible words

let me think
you have dictionary so you can loop dictionary

for each dictionary 
	check dict is anagram of words

check (w1, w2) -- calculating the given word again and again! pre calculate
	count each character should all match
	you can use hash table or array if character is a to z for example

	so tally count
	at the end compare ~ n

overall ~ dict len * n (n is the largest word len + given word)



after viewing video ( if you do this for many words yes you need to do this?)
how about key for each word based on char, count info ~ n
so you can only check these words against the given word
