questions
	same as actual task
	you need to know what problem means (example "find ip addresses from string")
		what do you mean? example? string length? possible character? context?

	base test cases


problem solving 
	familiarize/visualize with the problem through actual examples
	slow thinking, systemic, structured.
		try all data structures
		try 1, logn, n, n^2 so on
		analyze what is expensive and what is not

	unstuck with failure/simpler/dumber
	incremental approach


pseudo
	analyze


debug in brain
	practice


replace pseudo with actual code
	verify again
